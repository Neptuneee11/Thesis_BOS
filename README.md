Adviser: Dr. Ma. Regina Justina Estuar

This repository contains all of the research papers we can read and refer to when writing for something in thesis. Rules on how to use written down below.

# Why use git for this?

* In order to do more, one must have the discipline to do less - BoilerPlate from this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgV6M1LyfNY)
* Stores every PDF we could read for easy searching in our local machines using Adobe Acrobat
* Having a to-do list which will be shown in **github issues and milestones**
* Having a source list which will be a markdown file
* Accountability of who added what source using `git blame`

# Usage Rules

<u> Branch</u>: Only use main for now (2024 Jan 16) to commit PDFs you **might** read and cite for a future RRL.

<u> IDE</u>: I, Neptune, use vscode because it has a pdf reader and a markdown editor. 

<u> Adding a research paper</u>: Simply add the pdf into the repository

<u> Citation list</u>: add the citation for the research paper using the format below

#### Search 
Adobe Acrobat can search across pdf documents provided you all have the copies in your machine (which is the purpose of this repository)

To begin searching across documents, open Adobe Acrobat and follow the steps below.

1. **NOTE:** Only follow this if your Adobe Acrobat UI looks like this:
![New updated UI](/tutorialAssets/AANewUI.png)
Go to `Menu -> Disable new Acrobat Reader`
![disabling new UI](/tutorialAssets/getOutOfNew.png)\
It should now look like this
![old UI](/tutorialAssets/AAOldUI.png)

2. Go to `Edit -> Advanced search`
3. In the window that pops up, click the `All PDF Documents in` option and set the file path to the `sample papers` folder *(will change this once we actually get to typing)*
![popUP choose path](/tutorialAssets/searchHere.png)
4. Happy searching! 

# Github issues and milestones
Github offers a way to add tasks, assign someone to said task, and add that task to a group of tasks with a deadline.

#### Issues

You can name the task in the `Issues` tab in github
![issues tab](/tutorialAssets/IssuesTab.png)
Here, we can see there are two tasks already which is just the completion of this ReadMe.

Here's a more detailed view of one issue
![issue here](/tutorialAssets/issueHere.png)
Here, we can see who is assigned to what task and only they can close their assigned task provided theres a valid reason for doing so. Everyone can comment in that task. Another important thing to set is the **milestone** from this view.

#### Milestones

A milestone is a group of issues with a set deadline. Each issue must be set to a milestone.

### Integration with other apps

If you're using Notion or some other similar app, github can integrate with most of them. Here's a list and feel free to expand them

# FAQ

### Woudn't this be more work?
It may look like it but trust me, this would make writing final papers a lot more smoother when we can check for each other's sources. Also, everyone here knows how to use `git clone`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git stage`, and `git commit`. There's even the github UI for easier bits.

### I know other tools for citations and other purposes
Feel free to add here a tutorial on how to use them. The main purpose of this repository is to store possible sources we may use.

### Any new features you plan to add as the semester progresses?
It really depends on what kinds of papers would they ask us. For the first semester, they just need an RRL with 25+ sources and a project proposal.

Here's some possible texts we have to log probably (written at Jan 18, 2024)
* Notes from our meeting with our adviser Doc Estuar
* Source list with a link to the local file and the online DOI
* Compilation of past papers so we know what sources were marked important or irrelevant
* Probably our lab journal if they didn't require us a physical copy.

### Have you done this before?
This is a thing I think I should've done when I had to research back then. I might be biting more than I coould chew so I need your help in the maintenance of this system.
