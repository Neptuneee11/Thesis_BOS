This should probably be for the intro

The long awaited TF-NERD dataset. Tagalog has a limited amount of Datasets.. It used OntoNotes dataset for categorizing. It used news data for better work tagging the named entities. They used BERT.

This proposes the use of ontologies to narrow down the scope of the NER in order to reduce ambiguity. Domain and Ontologies are really needed.

##### Biomedical named entity recognition and linking datasets: survey and our recent development

NER can be applied to specific domain mostly in the medical field.
