I'm trying to see if I can summarize this paper bcs it looks like it contains everything we need to know about POS tagging

## Glossary

#lexical-class-marker : a label or tag to a word in a collection. Examples could be 'N' for Noun, 'ADJ' for adjective etc. 
#HMM : Also known as **Hidden Markov Model**. It is a graph where nodes are probability distributions over labels and edges give the probability of transitioning from one node to the other. It is takes in a sequence of inputs and spits out a sequence of outputs. Said outputs are calculated using aforementioned nodes that rely on probability.

#n-gram: In this context, predicting the next #lexical-class-marker based on the past n markers.

# POS Tagging
Parts-of-speech tagging is labelling words on in a collection. How it's tagged, the processes behind it, the different approaches, are what was discussed.
